## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Below is the syntax I need to pull from Google Sheets. I need to figure out how to create an access code. For now, I will just download my spreadsheet to show what I am collecting. Dr. Rawson in the library will help me in a week or so to start pulling HTML from the blogs you can see in the data set.
```{importing G-sheet data}
library(googlesheets)
gs_ls()
be <- gs_title("Parenting Blogs")
blogbasics <- gs_read(ss=be, bb = "BlogBasics", skip=1)
bb <- as.data.frame(blogbasics)

```
